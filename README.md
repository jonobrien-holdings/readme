# readme
I made this org with an old unused account of mine because github decided my real account [jonobrien](http://github.com/jonobrien) was a bit and all the public-facing content was removed. I could still commit to everything and comment on issues, but I could not stand having my pages site being down for 3+ days while I waited for support to unban/unrestrict my account.

I was not notified of any shady activiy on my account that would have caused this. I was not email about this happening. I just logged into my account to find a big red message saying

and I did not have anything in my security log for my profile showing weird behavior as well. This baffles me still and having not received a legitimate response from support about it, I hope this will prevent my content from being hidden again.
